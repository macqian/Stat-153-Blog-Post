## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/macqian/Stat-153-Blog-Post/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/macqian/Stat-153-Blog-Post/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Lebron James and the effort he needs to put into games to win

For the past 15 years, Lebron James has been one of the most dominant and recognized sports figures across the globe. But just how good has he been? To find out, we used a new metric called “Effort to Win” (E2W) that measures the physical effort Lebron James must exert in order to help his team win, and using that metric, we will forecast what his E2W will be for the first 10 games of the new NBA season.
